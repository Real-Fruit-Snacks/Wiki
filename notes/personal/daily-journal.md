# Daily Journal

## February 15, 2024

Today was a productive day. I managed to complete several important tasks:

- Finished the project proposal
- Had a great meeting with the team
- Learned about new React hooks

### Thoughts on Productivity

I've been experimenting with the **Pomodoro Technique** lately, and it's been quite effective. The key insights:

1. 25-minute focused sessions work well
2. Short breaks are essential
3. Tracking completed pomodoros is motivating

```javascript
// My custom timer function
function pomodoroTimer(minutes = 25) {
    const seconds = minutes * 60;
    let remaining = seconds;
    
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
        remaining--;
        console.log(`Time remaining: ${Math.floor(remaining / 60)}:${(remaining % 60).toString().padStart(2, '0')}`);
        
        if (remaining === 0) {
            clearInterval(interval);
            alert('Pomodoro complete!');
        }
    }, 1000);
}
```
