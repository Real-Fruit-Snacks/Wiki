# Best Practices Guide

Master the art of effective knowledge management with Notes Wiki. This guide covers proven strategies for organizing your notes, optimizing your workflow, and building a sustainable personal knowledge system.

## 🎯 Core Principles

### 1. Start Simple, Evolve Gradually
- **Begin with basics** - Don't over-organize initially
- **Develop patterns** - Let natural categories emerge
- **Iterate and improve** - Refine your system over time
- **Stay flexible** - Adapt to changing needs

### 2. Consistency is Key
- **Naming conventions** - Use predictable file and tag patterns
- **Frontmatter structure** - Standardize metadata fields
- **Writing style** - Develop your personal voice
- **Regular maintenance** - Schedule periodic reviews

### 3. Make it Searchable
- **Descriptive titles** - Clear, specific note names
- **Rich metadata** - Use tags, authors, and descriptions
- **Cross-linking** - Connect related concepts
- **Full-text content** - Write naturally for search

## 📝 Note-Taking Strategies

### Effective Note Structure

#### The PARA Method
Organize notes into four categories:
- **Projects** - Things with deadlines and outcomes
- **Areas** - Ongoing responsibilities to maintain
- **Resources** - Future reference materials
- **Archive** - Inactive items from the above

```
notes/
├── projects/
│   ├── website-redesign/
│   └── quarterly-report/
├── areas/
│   ├── health-fitness/
│   └── professional-development/
├── resources/
│   ├── templates/
│   └── reference-materials/
└── archive/
    └── completed-projects/
```

#### The Zettelkasten Method
Create atomic, interconnected notes:
- **One idea per note** - Keep notes focused
- **Unique identifiers** - Use consistent naming
- **Link everything** - Build a network of knowledge
- **Regular review** - Revisit and connect ideas

# Compound Interest Concept

Compound interest is interest calculated on both the principal amount and previously earned interest.

## Key Formula
A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

## Related Concepts

- [[202501191050-investment-strategies]] - Practical applications
```

### Content Guidelines

#### Write for Your Future Self
```markdown
<!-- Good: Context-rich -->
# Docker Container Debugging - Project Alpha Issue

**Context**: Production deployment failing on Project Alpha
**Date**: 2025-01-19
**Environment**: AWS ECS, Docker 20.10

## Problem
Container exits with code 137 during peak traffic...

<!-- Bad: Too minimal -->
# Docker Issue
Container broken, need to fix.
```

#### Use Progressive Disclosure
```markdown
# Machine Learning Model Training

## Quick Summary
Linear regression model for sales prediction. 
Accuracy: 87%. Ready for production.

## 🏗️ Organization Strategies

### Folder Structure Best Practices

#### By Context/Domain
```

#### Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
```
notes/
├── daily/              # Daily notes and journals
├── projects/           # Active projects with deadlines
├── areas/              # Ongoing areas of responsibility

├── archive/            # Completed or inactive content
└── inbox/              # Temporary holding for unprocessed notes
```

### Tagging Strategy

#### Hierarchical Tags
```yaml
tags: [programming, programming/python, programming/python/django]
```

#### Multi-Dimensional Tagging
```yaml
# Combine different tag types
tags: [
  # Content type
  tutorial, reference, meeting-notes,
  # Topic
  javascript, react, frontend,
  # Status
  draft, complete, needs-review,
  # Project
  project-alpha, client-beta,
  # Priority
  urgent, important, someday
]
```

#### Tag Conventions
```yaml
# Status tags
status/draft
status/review
status/complete
status/archived

# Content types
type/tutorial
type/reference
type/meeting
type/idea

# Areas of focus
area/work
area/personal
area/learning

# Time-based
year/2025
quarter/q1
sprint/sprint-10
```

## 📋 Workflow Optimization

### Daily Note-Taking Routine

#### Morning Setup (5 minutes)
```markdown
# Daily Note - 2025-01-19

## Today's Focus
- [ ] Complete project proposal
- [ ] Review team feedback
- [ ] Update documentation

## Quick Captures
<!-- Use this section throughout the day -->

## End of Day Review

```

#### Capture Everything
- **Inbox approach** - One place for all quick captures
- **Process regularly** - Daily or weekly inbox reviews
- **Move to permanent locations** - Organize processed items
- **Delete ruthlessly** - Remove outdated or irrelevant notes

#### Weekly Review Process
```markdown
# Weekly Review - Week of 2025-01-13

# Understanding Blockchain

## Simple Explanation (As if teaching a child)
A blockchain is like a digital notebook that many people share. 
When someone writes in it, everyone else can see what they wrote, 
and no one can erase or change what's already written.

## Technical Details
[Detailed technical explanations...]

## Analogies and Examples
- Like a public ledger that everyone can read but no one can alter
- Similar to a chain where each link contains information

## Questions I Still Have
- How does consensus work in practice?
- What are the energy implications?

## Related Concepts to Explore
- [[cryptocurrency-basics]]
- [[distributed-systems]]
```

## 🔍 Search and Discovery

### Making Notes Findable

#### Descriptive Titles
```markdown
<!-- Good -->
title: "Docker Multi-Stage Build Optimization for Node.js Apps"
title: "Weekly Team Retrospective - Sprint 15 - Key Insights"
title: "Python Data Visualization - Matplotlib vs Seaborn Comparison"

<!-- Less effective -->
title: "Docker Notes"
title: "Meeting Notes"
title: "Python Stuff"
```

#### Rich Descriptions
```yaml
description: "Step-by-step guide to optimizing Docker builds for Node.js applications using multi-stage builds, including before/after performance metrics and common pitfalls to avoid"
```

#### Strategic Keyword Usage
```markdown
# React Performance Optimization Techniques

Keywords for search: React, performance, optimization, rendering, 
hooks, memoization, virtual DOM, bundle size, code splitting

## Component Memoization
Using React.memo(), useMemo(), and useCallback() to prevent 
unnecessary re-renders and improve application performance...
```

### Cross-Linking Strategies
