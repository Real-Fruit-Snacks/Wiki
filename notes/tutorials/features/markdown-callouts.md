> This is the main information block.
> 
> > [!WARNING] Nested Warning
> > This is a warning inside the info block.
> > 
> > > [!TIP] Deeply Nested Tip
> > > This tip is nested two levels deep.

### Callouts with Rich Content

Callouts support all markdown formatting:

```markdown
> [!EXAMPLE] Rich Content Example
> You can include **bold text**, *italic text*, `inline code`, and even:
> 
> - Bullet points
> - Task lists: 
>   - [x] Completed task
>   - [ ] Pending task
> 
> | Column 1 | Column 2 |
> |----------|----------|
> | Data 1   | Data 2   |
> 
> ```javascript
> // Even code blocks!
> function example() {
>     return "Hello from inside a callout!";
> }
> ```
```

> Always backup your database before running migrations.

<!-- Less clear -->
> [!WARNING] 
> You might want to consider maybe backing up your database or something.
```

#### Match Content to Callout Type
```markdown
<!-- Good match -->
> [!DANGER] Data Loss Risk
> This command will permanently delete all files.

<!-- Poor match -->
> [!TIP] Data Loss Risk
> This command will permanently delete all files.
```

### Content Organization

#### Use Callouts Strategically
- **Don't overuse** - Too many callouts lose impact
- **Be consistent** - Use the same type for similar content
- **Consider flow** - Place callouts where they add value
- **Maintain hierarchy** - Use nested callouts thoughtfully

#### Combine with Other Elements
```markdown
# Installation Guide

## Prerequisites

> [!INFO] System Requirements
> - Node.js 16 or higher

> - [ ] Implement components
> - [ ] Write tests
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Theme Integration

### Color Adaptation
Callouts automatically adapt to your chosen theme:
- **Dark themes** - Muted colors with good contrast
- **Light themes** - Bright colors with proper readability
- **Custom themes** - Inherit theme color schemes

### Accessibility Features
- **High contrast** - Clear visual distinction
- **Screen reader support** - Proper semantic markup
- **Keyboard navigation** - Accessible to all users
- **Color independence** - Icons provide additional context

## ðŸ’¡ Creative Usage Ideas

### Learning Materials
Use callouts to create structured learning content:

```markdown
# JavaScript Fundamentals

> [!NOTE] Learning Objectives
> By the end of this lesson, you'll understand variables, functions, and objects.

> [!EXAMPLE] Variables
> ```javascript
> let message = "Hello, World!";
> const pi = 3.14159;
> ```

> [!TIP] Naming Convention
> Use camelCase for variable names: `firstName`, `lastName`

> [!QUESTION] Practice
> What would happen if you try to reassign a `const` variable?

> [!SUCCESS] Key Takeaway
> Variables are the building blocks of JavaScript programs.
```

### Project Management
Create visual project status updates:

```markdown
# Project Alpha - Weekly Update

> [!SUCCESS] Completed This Week
> - User authentication system
> - Database schema design
> - API endpoints for user management

> [!TODO] Next Week Goals
> - [ ] Implement password reset
> - [ ] Add email verification
> - [ ] Create admin dashboard

> [!WARNING] Blockers
> Waiting for design approval on the admin interface.

> [!IMPORTANT] Deadline Reminder
> MVP deadline is next Friday. All core features must be complete.
```

### Personal Notes
Enhance journal entries and personal documentation:

```markdown
# Daily Journal - 2025-01-19

> [!SUCCESS] Wins Today
> - Completed the callout tutorial
> - Fixed three critical bugs
> - Had a productive team meeting

> [!QUESTION] Reflection
> What could I have done better during the client presentation?

> [!TIP] Tomorrow's Focus
> Start working on the new feature requirements early.

> [!TODO] Personal Goals
> - [ ] Exercise for 30 minutes
> - [ ] Read one chapter of "Clean Code"
> - [ ] Update project documentation
```

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Parsing Rules
The callout system uses these parsing rules:
- Must start with `> [!TYPE]` 
- Type must be one of the 13 supported types
- Optional title follows the type
- Content continues with `>` prefix on each line

### CSS Classes
Each callout generates HTML with specific classes:
- `.callout` - Base callout styling
- `.callout-{type}` - Type-specific styling (e.g., `.callout-warning`)
- `.callout-header` - Title section
- `.callout-icon` - Icon container
- `.callout-content` - Content area

### JavaScript Processing
The markdown processor:
1. Detects callout syntax
2. Extracts type and title
3. Generates appropriate HTML structure
4. Applies theme-aware styling
5. Includes semantic markup for accessibility

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Reference

### Syntax Template
```markdown
> [!TYPE] Optional Title
> Your content here
> Multiple lines supported
> **Markdown** formatting works
```

### All Types at a Glance
- `NOTE` - General information
- `INFO` - Important facts
- `TIP` - Helpful advice
- `SUCCESS` - Positive outcomes
- `QUESTION` - Queries and prompts
- `WARNING` - Potential issues
