# Table of Contents Navigation

The Table of Contents (TOC) feature automatically generates an outline from your note's headings, making it easy to navigate long documents.

## üéØ How It Works

### Automatic Generation
When you open any note with multiple headings, a Table of Contents appears on the right side of the screen. It:
- Extracts all headings (H1-H6) from your note
- Creates a hierarchical, clickable outline
- Updates automatically as you edit

### Visual Indicators
- **Active Section Highlighting**: The current section you're reading is highlighted
- **Progress Tracking**: A subtle indicator shows how far you've scrolled
- **Nested Structure**: Sub-headings are indented to show document structure

## üñ±Ô∏è Using the Table of Contents

### Click to Navigate
Simply click any heading in the TOC to jump directly to that section. The page scrolls smoothly to bring the section into view.

### Collapse and Expand
- Click the **collapse icon** at the top to hide the TOC
- Click again to expand it
- Your preference is remembered

### Auto-Hide on Mobile
On smaller screens, the TOC automatically hides to save space. You can still access it by clicking the TOC button.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings and Customization

### Enable/Disable TOC
1. Open Settings (`Ctrl+,`)
2. Find "Show Table of Contents"
3. Toggle on/off as desired

### When TOC Appears
The Table of Contents only appears when:
- The note has 2 or more headings
- The setting is enabled
- There's enough screen width (desktop/tablet)

## üìù Writing TOC-Friendly Notes

### Best Practices
1. **Use Clear Headings**: Make headings descriptive
2. **Maintain Hierarchy**: Use proper heading levels (H1 ‚Üí H2 ‚Üí H3)
3. **Keep It Organized**: Group related content under appropriate headings

### Example Structure
```markdown
# Main Title (H1)

## Introduction (H2)
Content here...

## Main Concepts (H2)

### Concept One (H3)
Explanation...

### Concept Two (H3)
More details...

## Conclusion (H2)
Final thoughts...
```

## üé® Visual Styling

The TOC adapts to your chosen theme:
- **Light themes**: Clean borders and subtle backgrounds
- **Dark themes**: Appropriate contrast for easy reading
- **Accent colors**: Match your theme's primary color

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Keyboard Navigation**: After clicking a TOC item, use arrow keys to read
2. **Quick Collapse**: Double-click the TOC header to toggle
3. **Smooth Scrolling**: All navigation uses smooth scrolling for better UX
4. **Reading Position**: The TOC remembers your position even after collapse

## üîß Troubleshooting

### TOC Not Showing?
- Check if the note has at least 2 headings
- Verify TOC is enabled in settings
- Try refreshing the page (F5)

### Incorrect Highlighting?
- This can happen with very short sections
- The highlight updates as you scroll
- Click a heading to ensure proper positioning
