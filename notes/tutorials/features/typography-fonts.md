## Typography Best Practices

### For Reading

1. **Long articles**: Use Serif font with Normal or Large size
2. **Quick reference**: Sans-serif with Normal size
3. **Extended sessions**: Large size with Narrow width
4. **Dark themes**: Consider increasing font size slightly

### For Different Content Types

## Accessibility Considerations

### For Visual Comfort

2. **Eye strain**: Try Large size with Narrow width
3. **Dyslexia**: Sans-serif fonts often help
4. **Light sensitivity**: Combine with dark themes

### High Contrast Tips

- Larger font sizes work better with high contrast themes
- Sans-serif fonts provide clearer character shapes
- Narrow width reduces line tracking difficulty

## Theme and Typography Interaction

Different themes work better with different typography settings:

### Dark Themes
- Slightly larger font size improves readability
- Sans-serif fonts reduce character blur
- Consider increasing content width

### Light Themes
- Normal font sizes work well
- Both serif and sans-serif are readable
- Narrow width enhances focus

### Special Effect Themes
- May require font size adjustment
- Test readability with your chosen settings
- Some decorative themes work better with specific fonts

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Fonts look blurry**
A: Try switching to System font or adjusting your browser's zoom level

**Q: JetBrains Mono isn't loading**
A: The font loads automatically. Try refreshing the page.

**Q: Changes aren't applying**

A: Some themes may affect perceived size. Adjust font size to compensate.

## Tips for Optimal Reading

1. **Test different combinations** - Try various font/size/width combinations
2. **Consider your screen** - Larger screens may benefit from larger fonts
3. **Time of day matters** - Use larger fonts when tired
4. **Match your content** - Technical content may need different settings
