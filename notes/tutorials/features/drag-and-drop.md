# Drag and Drop

NotesWiki includes intuitive drag and drop functionality that makes organizing your workspace effortless. You can reorder tabs, open notes in specific locations, and manage your workspace with simple mouse gestures.

## Tab Reordering

The most common use of drag and drop is reordering your tabs to organize your workspace.

### How to Reorder Tabs

1. **Click and hold** on any tab (except pinned tabs)
2. **Drag** the tab left or right to your desired position
3. **Look for the visual indicator** - a blue line shows where the tab will be placed
4. **Release** the mouse button to drop the tab in its new position

### Visual Feedback

When dragging tabs, you'll see:
- **Dragging state** - The tab being dragged becomes slightly transparent
- **Drop indicator** - A blue vertical line shows exactly where the tab will be placed
- **Hover effects** - Other tabs respond as you drag over them

### Tab Reordering Rules

- **Regular tabs** can be freely reordered
- **Pinned tabs** cannot be dragged (they stay in place)
- **Tabs maintain their state** when reordered (content, scroll position, etc.)
- **Changes persist** across sessions

## Drag and Drop from File Tree

When split view is enabled, you can drag notes from the file tree directly into split panes.

### How to Use Split View Drag and Drop

1. **Enable split view** using the split view button or `Ctrl + /`
2. **Locate a note** in the file tree
3. **Drag the note** from the file tree
4. **Drop it** onto either the left or right pane
5. The note will open in that specific pane

### Split View Rules

- Only works when split view is active
- Cannot drop onto pinned panes
- Visual indicators show which pane will receive the note
- Maintains existing pane content until drop is completed

## Best Practices

### 1. Organize by Workflow
- Keep related tabs together
- Place frequently accessed tabs at the beginning
- Group tabs by project or context

### 2. Use with Pinned Tabs
- Pin important tabs first
- Organize regular tabs around pinned ones
- Pinned tabs serve as anchors for your layout

### 3. Combine with Keyboard Shortcuts
- Use `Alt + 1-9` to quickly jump to reordered tabs
- Reorder tabs to match number key access patterns
- Place most important tabs in positions 1-3

## Advanced Tips

### Quick Reorganization
1. Close unnecessary tabs first
2. Pin reference tabs
3. Drag remaining tabs into logical order
4. Use split view for side-by-side work

### Workflow Patterns

**Research Pattern**:
- Pin main research topic
- Arrange source tabs in reading order
- Keep notes tab at the end

**Development Pattern**:
- Pin documentation
- Order: specs → implementation → tests
- Keep reference materials together

**Writing Pattern**:
- Pin outline or structure
- Arrange research tabs chronologically
- Keep draft at a consistent position

## Limitations

### What You Cannot Drag
- **Pinned tabs** - These are locked in position
- **System tabs** - Special tabs like split view when pinned
- **Between windows** - Drag and drop only works within the same window

### Browser Compatibility
- Works in all modern browsers
- Touch devices may have limited support
- Some browsers may show different visual feedback

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Alternatives
If you cannot use drag and drop:
- Use the tab context menu to close and reopen tabs in desired order
- Utilize numbered shortcuts (`Alt + 1-9`) for quick access
- Pin important tabs to keep them accessible

### Visual Indicators
- High contrast drop indicators
- Clear hover states
- Smooth animations for better tracking

## Troubleshooting

**Q: I can't drag a tab**
A: Check if the tab is pinned. Pinned tabs cannot be dragged.

**Q: Drag and drop isn't working**
A: Try refreshing the page. Ensure JavaScript is enabled.

**Q: The tab jumped to the wrong position**
A: Wait for the drop indicator to appear before releasing.

**Q: Can I drag multiple tabs?**
A: No, only one tab can be dragged at a time.
