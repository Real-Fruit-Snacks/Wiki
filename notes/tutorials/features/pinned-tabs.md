# Pinned Tabs

Pinned tabs are a powerful feature that allows you to keep important notes always accessible and protected from accidental closure. When you pin a tab, it remains open and its content cannot be changed, making it perfect for reference materials, frequently accessed notes, or important documentation.

## What are Pinned Tabs?

Pinned tabs are special tabs that:
- **Cannot be closed accidentally** - Protected from closure via close button, keyboard shortcuts, or bulk close operations
- **Cannot have their content changed** - The note loaded in a pinned tab stays locked
- **Cannot be dragged** - Pinned tabs stay in their position
- **Persist across sessions** - Pinned tabs remain pinned when you reload the application
- **Have visual indicators** - Shows a pin icon and hides the close button

## How to Pin a Tab

There are two ways to pin a tab:

### 1. Using the Context Menu
1. Right-click on any tab
2. Select "Pin Tab" from the context menu
3. The tab will now show a pin icon (ðŸ“Œ) instead of a close button

### 2. Using Keyboard Shortcut
- Press `Alt + P` while the tab is active
- The tab will be instantly pinned

## How to Unpin a Tab

To unpin a tab and return it to normal:

### 1. Using the Context Menu
1. Right-click on the pinned tab
2. Select "Unpin Tab" from the context menu
3. The close button will reappear

### 2. Using Keyboard Shortcut
- Press `Alt + P` while the pinned tab is active
- The tab will be unpinned

## Pinned Tab Protection

Pinned tabs are protected in several ways:

### 1. Close Protection
- **Individual close** - Clicking close button or middle-click shows a warning
- **Close All Tabs** - Pinned tabs remain open
- **Close Other Tabs** - Pinned tabs are not affected
- **Keyboard shortcuts** - Protected from Ctrl+W or similar shortcuts

### 2. Content Protection
- **Navigation blocked** - Clicking links in the sidebar won't change pinned tab content
- **Search results** - Opening search results won't affect pinned tabs
- **URL navigation** - Direct URL changes are blocked for pinned tabs
- **Split view** - Pinned split view tabs maintain their content

### 3. Visual Protection
- **No close button** - Prevents accidental clicks
- **Pin icon** - Clear visual indicator
- **Drag disabled** - Cannot be accidentally moved

## Use Cases for Pinned Tabs

### 1. Reference Documentation
Pin important reference materials that you need to consult frequently:
- API documentation
- Style guides
- Configuration references
- Cheat sheets

### 2. Task Lists
Keep your daily todo list or project tasks always visible:
- Daily agenda
- Project milestones
- Sprint backlogs
- Meeting notes

### 3. Quick Access Notes
Pin frequently accessed notes for instant access:
- Contact lists
- Important links
- Credentials (if stored securely)
- Template documents

### 4. Split View Reference
Use pinned tabs in split view for side-by-side reference:
- Pin documentation on one side
- Work on implementation on the other
- Compare versions or translations
- Review guidelines while writing

## Best Practices

1. **Pin sparingly** - Only pin tabs you truly need to keep open
2. **Use descriptive titles** - Make sure pinned tabs have clear, identifiable titles
3. **Organize pinned tabs** - Keep pinned tabs grouped at the beginning
4. **Review regularly** - Unpin tabs that are no longer needed
5. **Combine with split view** - Pin reference material in split view for maximum productivity

A: There's no limit, but for usability, we recommend pinning only essential tabs.
