# Sticky Notes

Sticky notes provide a quick way to capture thoughts, reminders, and temporary notes that float above your workspace. Perfect for jotting down ideas while reading or working on other content.

## Creating Sticky Notes

### 🖱️ Click Method
Click the sticky note icon (document with lines) in the header navigation bar.

### ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcut
Press **Ctrl+Shift+S** (or **Cmd+Shift+S** on Mac) to instantly create a new sticky note.

## Features

### 🎨 Four Color Options
- **Yellow**: Default classic sticky note color
- **Blue**: Cool and professional
- **Green**: Nature-inspired and calming  
- **Pink**: Vibrant and attention-grabbing

### 📐 Fully Interactive
- **Drag**: Click and drag the header to move anywhere on screen
- **Resize**: Drag the bottom-right corner to resize
- **Minimize**: Click the **−** button to collapse to header only
- **Expand**: Click the **□** button to restore full size

## Sticky Note Controls

Each sticky note has a header with several action buttons:

### 🎨 Color Cycling
- **Button**: Paint palette icon
- **Action**: Click to cycle through yellow → blue → green → pink

### 🗕 Minimize/Maximize
- **Minimize (−)**: Collapses to header only
- **Maximize (□)**: Restores to full size
- **Use case**: Keep important reminders visible but compact

### ❌ Close

### 🎨 Organization

- **Minimize when not active** to reduce clutter  
- **Use consistent positioning** for different types of notes

### 🔄 Workflow Integration

- Jot down cross-references between notes
- Capture spontaneous ideas during research
- Track temporary reminders during work sessions

Sticky notes bridge the gap between fleeting thoughts and permanent knowledge, making your note-taking workflow more fluid and efficient!
